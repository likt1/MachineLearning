# **MachineLearning** CS6073

**Programming language used**: Matlab
## Assignment 1 : Iris flower Find_S algorithm

**Algorithm performed** : Find_S algorithm

**Description** : Following a given data set, we were to perform the Find_S algorithm to find out the different accuracies based on the different k values given. It was required for us to apply as much matrix manipulations possible during this task. Requirement and grading was set on the different graphs (histograms) produced after running the algorithm 100 times over for each of the given k values.
